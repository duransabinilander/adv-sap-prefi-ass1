## Assignment in Advanced Systems Integration & Architecture
1. Define Service Oriented Architecture(SOA).
- Based to my research, service-oriented architecture (SOA) is a software development methodology wherein individual services offer a business capability and facilitate cross-platform communication with one another.

2. List and discuss the characteristics of SOA.
- Reusability, it said that it creates a flywheel effoect of innovation and application are made from existing service.

- Scalability, it is the property of a system t o handle and it work on various servers within the environment.

- Reliability, it is the overall consistency of a measure and has extra secure because it is simple to test shortcodes.

3. Define Microservices.
-based on internet, microservices is an architectural and organizational approach to software and this services are owned by small, self contained teams.

4. List and discuss the benefits of using Microservices.
- improved productivity, it is said to adding additional workers to process the new  task without affecting the efficiency

- Increased scalability, it says that Individual services can also be scaled independently, and new components can be added without requiring downtime and redeployment of the entire system. 

- Optimize business functionality, it says that A microservices approach uses several independently small services that are segmented and deployable while operating a unique method communicated through a smaller device. 

5. List and discuss the similarities and differences of SOA and Microservices.

based on my research the difference between SOA and Microservices, first in terms of speed SOA Slow down as more services are added on but microservices is consistent speed as traffic grows and for governance flexibility, SOA is consistent data for governance across all services and microservices is different data governance policies for each storage.
